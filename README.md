# Using the application
Please download the runserver script [runserver.sh](https://github.com/devinv44/TobaccoTestimonies/blob/master/runserver.sh). Note clearly where you have downloaded this file. Once it has downloaded, navigate to the location of the file. If you are using a terminal, run the server using ./runserver.sh. If you are looking through your file manager please double click the file. This will ask you for a password for the virtual machine, which you will need to recieve from Dr. Fox or Dr. Townsend beforehand. Enter in the password correctly and the server will start on the virtual machine and you will be able to connect to the server from your machine. To connect to the server navigate to [localhost:8000](localhost:8000) in the browser of your choosing. 

Once the application is running, you will be able to enter a desired topic for the clustering and see your results displayed in your browser.
